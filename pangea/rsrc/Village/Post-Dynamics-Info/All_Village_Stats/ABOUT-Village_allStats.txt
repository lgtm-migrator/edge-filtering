Note that Villages 1&6, 2&8, 3&5, and 4&7 are identical simulations, the only 
difference being that villages 1-4 were sampled at 25% and given as sequences,
and villages 5-8 were sampled at 50% and given as trees. 
[The villages were actually sampled at 75% and then 1/3 of this used as the 
25% sample and 2/3 used as the 50% sample, so that no samples overlap between
the two data sets.]

'25%' ('50%') means that 25% (50%) of the total number of individuals infected 
and alive at any time between the start of year 40 and the end of year 44 were 
sampled. The individuals to be sampled were selected first and then the sample 
times randomized (realistically - only when the individual was alive and 
infected) through the sampling time.

* Villages 1&6, 2&8, 3&5, and 4&7 contain sampling/sequence coverage for both 
the 25% (villages 1-4) and 50% (villages 5-8) samplings

* All values are for the *END OF* the year value (e.g. - number of individuals 
infected at the end of 0.5 years)

* All simulations start with 1 infected female, so number of infected females 
in the first 0.5 year is always 1 less than the number of new female 
infections in the first 0.5 year

* All male/female values are for the gender of the *infected* individual - not
the gender of the transmitter. For example, the percNewInfectFromAcute.Female
is the proportion of females infected that were infected while their 
transmitter (of male gender - no same-sex transmission) was in the acute 
stage. 

* Unlike other values, sample/sequence coverage is a proportion of the *total*
number of samples/sequences taken, to show any differences in sampling over
time between men and women (designed to be sampled equally, differences are 
due to other underlying causes in the simulation - e.g. more of one gender 
infected than the other)

* Some population-level numbers like overall prevalence and incidence haven't
been included but can be calculated from summing male and female values 
provided
